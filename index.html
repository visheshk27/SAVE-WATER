<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="list-group-item">Always turn taps off tightly so they do not drip.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Promptly repair any leaks in and around your taps. (One leak can waste several thousand litres of water per year.)</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Use an aerator and/or a water flow-reducer attachment on your tap to reduce your water usage.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">When hand-washing dishes, never run water continuously. Wash dishes in a partially filled sink and then rinse them using the spray attachment on your tap.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">If you have an electric dishwasher, use it only to wash full loads, and use the shortest cycle possible. Many dishwashers have a conserver/water-miser cycle.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">When brushing your teeth, turn the water off while you are actually brushing. Use short bursts of water for cleaning your brush. (This saves about 80% of the water normally used.)</li>
<li class="list-group-item">When washing or shaving, partially fill the sink and use that water rather than running the tap continuously. (This saves about 60% of the water normally used.) Use short bursts of water to clean razors.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Use either low-flow shower heads or adjustable flow-reducer devices on your shower heads. (They reduce flow by at least 25%.)</li>
<li class="list-group-item">You can reduce water usage by 40% to 50% by installing low-flush toilets.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Wash only full loads in your washing machine.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Use the shortest cycle possible for washing clothes, and use the "suds-saver" feature if your machine has one.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Use only cleaning products that will not harm the environment when they are washed away after use. Look for "environmentally friendly" products when shopping.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Lawns and gardens require only 5 millimetres of water per day during warm weather. Less is needed during spring, fall, or cool weather.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Water lawns every three to five days, rather than for a short period every day. In warm weather, apply 5 millimetres of water for each day since the last watering.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Water during the cool part of the day, in the morning or evening. Do not water on windy days.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Do not over-water in anticipation of a shortage. Soil cannot store extra water.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Use shut-off timers or on-off timers, if possible. Do not turn on sprinklers and leave for the day.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Water scarcity</strong> (also called <strong>water stress</strong> or <strong>water crisis</strong>) is the lack of <a title="Fresh water" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_water">fresh water</a> resources to meet the standard <a title="Capitalism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#Supply_and_demand">water demand</a>. Humanity is facing a water crisis, due to unequal distribution (exacerbated by <a title="Climate change" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change">climate change</a>) resulting in some very wet and some very dry geographic locations, plus a sharp rise in global freshwater demand in recent decades driven by industry. Water scarcity can also be caused by droughts, lack of rainfall, or pollution. This was listed in 2019 by the <a title="World Economic Forum" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum">World Economic Forum</a> as one of the largest <a title="Global Risks Report" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Risks_Report">global risks</a> in terms of potential impact over the next decade.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> It is manifested by partial or no satisfaction of expressed demand, economic competition for water quantity or quality, disputes between users, irreversible depletion of <a title="Groundwater" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater">groundwater</a>, and negative impacts on the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Environment (biology)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biology)">environment</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FAO2012_2-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity#cite_note-FAO2012-2">[2]</a></sup> Two-thirds of the global population (4 billion people) live under conditions of severe water scarcity at least 1 month of the year.<sup id="cite_ref-:7_3-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity#cite_note-:7-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-weforum17_4-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity#cite_note-weforum17-4">[4]</a></sup> Half a billion people in the world face severe water scarcity all year round.<sup id="cite_ref-:7_3-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity#cite_note-:7-3">[3]</a></sup> Half of the world's <a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis">largest cities</a> experience water scarcity.<sup id="cite_ref-weforum17_4-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity#cite_note-weforum17-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The essence of global water scarcity is the geographic and temporal mismatch between <a title="Fresh water" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_water">fresh water</a> demand and availability.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> The <a title="Population growth" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth">increasing</a> <a title="World population" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population">world population</a>, improving <a class="mw-redirect" title="Living standard" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_standard">living standards</a>, changing <a title="Consumer behaviour" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_behaviour">consumption patterns</a>, and expansion of <a title="Irrigation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation">irrigated agriculture</a> are the main driving forces for the rising global demand for water.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> <a title="Climate change" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change">Climate change</a>, such as altered weather-patterns (including <a class="mw-redirect" title="Droughts" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droughts">droughts</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" title="Floods" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floods">floods</a>), <a title="Deforestation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation">deforestation</a>, increased <a title="Water pollution" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution">pollution</a>, green house gases, and wasteful use of water can cause insufficient supply.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_9-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity#cite_note-:2-9">[9]</a></sup> At the global level and on an annual basis, enough freshwater is available to meet such demand, but <a title="Spatial analysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_analysis">spatial</a> and temporal variations of water demand and availability are large, leading to (physical) water scarcity in several parts of the world during specific times of the year.<sup id="cite_ref-:7_3-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity#cite_note-:7-3">[3]</a></sup> Scarcity varies over time as a result of natural <a title="Hydrology" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology">hydrological</a> variability, but varies even more so as a function of prevailing economic policy, planning and management approaches. Scarcity can be expected to intensify with most forms of <a title="Economic development" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development">economic development</a>, but, if correctly identified, many of its causes can be predicted, avoided or mitigated.<sup id="cite_ref-FAO2012_2-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity#cite_note-FAO2012-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a title="International Resource Panel" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Resource_Panel">International Resource Panel</a> of the UN states that governments have tended to invest heavily in largely inefficient solutions: mega-projects like <a title="Dam" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam">dams</a>, canals, <a title="Aqueduct (water supply)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueduct_(water_supply)">aqueducts</a>, pipelines and water reservoirs, which are generally neither environmentally sustainable nor economically viable. The most <a title="Cost-effectiveness analysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-effectiveness_analysis">cost-effective</a> way of decoupling water use from economic growth, according to the scientific panel, is for <a title="Government" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government">governments</a> to create <a title="Systems ecology" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_ecology">holistic</a> water <a title="Integrated water resources management" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_water_resources_management">management plans</a> that take into account the entire water cycle: from source to distribution, economic use, <a title="Water treatment" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_treatment">treatment</a>, <a title="Reclaimed water" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reclaimed_water">recycling</a>, reuse and return to the environment.</p>
